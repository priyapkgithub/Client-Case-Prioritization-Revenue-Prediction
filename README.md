 # Legal Case Prioritization & Revenue Prediction
Project Highlights:
Synthetic Dataset Generation
Created a realistic dataset of 1,000+ legal case records using Python (NumPy, Pandas), simulating real-world parameters like case complexity, urgency, and internal resource availability.

ML Pipeline Development
Built a Random Forest Classifier to predict case priority (High/Medium/Low). Achieved ~85% accuracy, with clear insights from the confusion matrix and feature importance.

Business Integration with Power BI
Exported model outputs to a Power BI dashboard to visualize:

Case status and predicted priority

Lawyer workload balancing

Potential revenue segmentation
This enabled data-driven decision-making for client onboarding and staff allocation.

Tools Used: Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Power BI

💼 Business Value:
Helped streamline internal prioritization logic for client intake.

Enabled early identification of high-revenue or urgent cases.

Assisted the legal ops team with actionable visualizations and lawyer load management.

💡 Key Learnings:
Bridged the gap between machine learning models and real-world business use in a legal domain.

Understood the importance of feature design and data encoding in classification tasks.

Gained hands-on experience in presenting data insights via dashboards for non-technical stakeholders.
